# The Weather STAR Revamped

This project is an update to https://github.com/thetechknight/wsjr-modulator that replaces the Arduino Mega, with a Reaspberry Pi Zero. This allows you to write a data sending solution on device instead of requiring a connection to another computer or server for data.

The `schematic` folder contains the updated schematic and board layout files in KiCad 8. 
`schematic_orig` contains thetechknight's original EAGLE cad schematic.
`code` contains code written for the Arduino based board written for  BASCOM-AVR.
